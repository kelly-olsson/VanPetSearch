        <p>Kelly Olsson is currently a student at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. 
          She is the owner of two precocious cats and knows the fear and anxiety that comes 
          with having a pet escape. When she came across the well-maintained online data that 
          Animal Control in the City of Vancouver keeps on animals, she came up
          with the idea of VanPetSearch.</p>
          <p>She hopes that the site will help worried pet owners in Vancouver to find answers
            about their lost pets.</p>
          <p>If you would like to make suggestions to improve the site, please don't hesitate to
            contact her <a href="mailto:kolsson@gmail.com">here.</a></p>
